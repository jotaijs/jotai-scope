just intercept the getter of the store everywhere all the way up to the base store.

computed atoms are like implicit atoms but reverse
computed atoms are not copied
reverseImplicitSet is a set of computed atoms to indicate whether a computed atom should be treated as a reverse implicit
the atom is removed from the set between recomputations
by intercepting the readFn, if an atom is `get` that is either an explicit or reverse implicit,

- then the atom is added to the reverse implicit set

only the readFn determines if the atom is added to the reverse implicit set
intercepting the readFn and writeFn is used to get the "correct" atom
when a computed atom converts to reverse implicit,

- its atomState is created from scratch
- this is because the atomState stores a different value for the scoped atom and can have different dependencies

**Special Case:** on first read, when a computed atom reads a scoped atom,

1. it is added to the reverse implicit set
1. the atomState is copied from the unscoped atomState
1. getAtomState points to the scoped atomState

the atomStateProxy is no longer needed.
